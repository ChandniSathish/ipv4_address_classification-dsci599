<a name="overview"></a>
## **1. Overview**
This repository explores how **machine learning** can characterize **IP address usage** patterns. We derive features from active-probing data (e.g., availability, volatility, and RTT statistics) and feed these into both **unsupervised** (K-Means) and **supervised** (RandomForest) models to classify IP addresses as:
- **Always-on** (near 100% availability)
- **Rarely responsive** (low availability)
- **High-latency** or **ephemeral** (potentially behind NAT or DHCP)

**Key Objectives**  
- Understand address blocks that are consistently online vs. highly variable.  
- Integrate reverse DNS analysis for label generation.  
- Explore potential ISP and security applications.

<a name="getting-started"></a>
## **3. Getting Started**
### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>
```

### Create a Virtual Environment & Install Dependencies
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
# or .\venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data Preparation
Place your raw CSVs or archived data in `data/raw/`.
Use the included Jupyter notebook `dsci599.ipynb` or the scripts/ directory to preprocess and produce `data/processed/` files.

<a name="usage--scripts"></a>
## **4. Usage & Scripts**

### `dsci599.ipynb`
A Jupyter notebook showcasing the core data-cleaning pipeline, feature engineering (availability, volatility, RTT stats), and preliminary clustering/classification results.
To run:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/dsci599.ipynb
```
Follow the notebook cells step-by-step to replicate the analysis and visualize results.

### `cluster_analysis.py`
Performs unsupervised clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN) on the processed dataset.
Command-line usage example:
```bash
python scripts/cluster_analysis.py --data "data/processed/feature_set.csv" \
  --method kmeans \
  --clusters 4
```
Outputs cluster labels, silhouette scores, and intermediate plots in `results/`.

### `dns_lookup.py`
Bulk reverse DNS (PTR) lookups for each IP in `data/processed/feature_set.csv`.
Extracts keywords such as nat, dhcp, etc., and augments the dataset with new labels for supervised learning.
Example:
```bash
python scripts/dns_lookup.py \
  --input "data/processed/feature_set.csv" \
  --output "data/processed/feature_set_dns.csv"
```

### `train_model.py`
Trains a supervised classifier (RandomForest, XGBoost, etc.) using derived labels from `dns_lookup.py` plus features from `cluster_analysis.py`.
Example:
```bash
python scripts/train_model.py \
  --input "data/processed/feature_set_dns.csv" \
  --model randomforest
```
Outputs confusion matrix, classification report, and feature importance plots in `results/`.

<a name="data-description"></a>
## **5. Data Description**
- **`data/raw/`**: Contains raw IP-level probing results (availability, RTT samples).
  - Example CSV:
    ```csv
    ip_address, availability, volatility, median_rtt, std_rtt
    8.8.8.8,   0.95,         0.85,       0.042,      0.010
    ...
    ```

- **`data/processed/`**: Holds cleaned/combined datasets after removing outliers and merging with reverse DNS info.
  - Important: Large data files are not tracked in this repo. If needed, place them in `data/raw/` and mention them in `.gitignore`.

<a name="results--outputs"></a>
## **6. Results & Outputs**
- **Clustering Results**: K-Means outputs cluster labels (e.g., always-up, rarely-up, high-latency, etc.).
- **Supervised Classification**: RandomForest or XGBoost confusion matrix, feature importances, and accuracy metrics.
- **Graphs & Tables**: Stored in `results/figures/` and `results/tables/`, respectively.

Example table of cluster interpretation:
| Cluster | Availability (avg) | Volatility (avg) | RTT Median (avg) | Interpretation |
|---------|--------------------|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| 0       | 0.001              | 1.0              | 0.0007           | Mostly unresponsive, ephemeral toggles |
| 1       | 0.996              | 1.0              | 0.045            | Highly stable, moderate latency |
| 2       | 0.0008             | 0.5              | 0.170            | Rarely online, but very high latency |
| 3       | ...                | ...              | ...              | ...            |

<a name="future-work"></a>
## **7. Future Work**
- **Refine Volatility Metrics**: Investigate whether a near-1.0 value is due to single up/down events or a bug in the formula.
- **Reverse-DNS Integration**: Expand the scope of hostname-based labeling to catch more patterns (e.g., ppp, adsl, mobile).
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Collect data for multiple weeks or months, analyzing changes in usage patterns over longer intervals.
- **Poster & Final Report**: As part of Project C, finalize the method, results, and present them in a poster session.
